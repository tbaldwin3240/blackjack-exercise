1. Familiarise yourself with the HTML and JS
    -some of the HTML elements:
        -classes: message-box, table, player, player-name, points, hand
        -images, labels
        -buttons (styled in a flexbox)
    -JS elements:
        - .window.addEventListener(‘DOMContentLoaded’, function () {
            //Execute after page load
        })
            -working with the BOM and the DOM
            -attaching an event handler to the specified element
            -DOMContentLoaded event fires when the initial HTML document has been completely
            loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to
            finish loading
