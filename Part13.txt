13. Busts
    -check for busts after each card is dealt
        -a bust is when either the dealer or the playerâ€™s hand go over 21 points; when you bust, you lose
            -maybe add a for loop and an if condition
        -if there is a bust, display a message on the page saying that they busted
            -add an alert
            -there is a div with an id of messages already on the page
