6. Creating a Deck
    -create a deck of cards
        -our deck can be an array of objects
            -each one of the objects in the deck will represent a card
            -each card will have a rank and a suit
            -ex. Queen of Hearts: { rank: 12, suit: ‘hearts’ }
        -we don’t have to manually code a whole deck of cards; we can write a function to generate a deck of 52 cards
            -create a buildDeck function- this will return a new array with 52 card objects
                -there are 4 suits; for each suit, there is a rank from 1-13
