4. Dealing the cards
    -once you have an idea of how you want the HTML to look, you can remove the cards from step 3
    -now you can generate them dynamically with JS
    -when the “Deal” button is clicked, deal 4 times
        -player
        -dealer
        -player
        -dealer
     -you will need to attach an event listener to the button
        -create a new img element
    -append the new img to the #dealer-hand and #player-hand elements
        -you can just use the same card
